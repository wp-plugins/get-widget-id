Get ID of any active widget.

== Description ==
As the name suggests the **Get Widget ID Plugin** allows you to display the widget id in the widget form. 

One can also get the widget id by inspecting the html but I find that rather tedious. So I wrote this short snippet.

No more inspecting elements and messing with html. Simply install this plugin and you are good to go. 

It is based on this [Tutorial](http://spicemailer.com/wordpress/get-widget-id-wordpress/)
